//The latest ECMAScript(ES6) standard defines following data types: Out of which six data types are Primitive(predefined). 

//Numbers: Represent both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.

//String: A string is a sequence of characters. In JavaScript, strings can be enclosed within the single or double quotes. Example: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.

//Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

//Null: This type has only one value : null.

//Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.

//Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in detail in further articles.

  // var myNull = null; // null
